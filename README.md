# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project
## Artist Website for Mark Dennis
In my spare time I produce trance music. So I came up with the idea to showcase my music by building a website which lets people listen to it, and provide links to purchase the music. There is also a page for people to sign up for new release dates and a newsletter.
