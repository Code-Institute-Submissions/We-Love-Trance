# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

## Artist Website for Mark Dennis

In my spare time I produce trance music. So I came up with the idea to showcase my music by building a website which lets people listen to it, and provide links to purchase the music. There is also a page for people to sign up for new release dates and a newsletter.

I decided on a home page that would act as a biography, a listen page so people can stream my music, and a sign up page for people to leave their email address for updates on new releases. I can go back to completing this when I have learnt the appropriate back end programming.

## UX

The aim for my website was to showcase my music. I felt that the layout should be simple and took inspiration from the bootstrap tutorials and worked in thirds. I wanted to have the same navigation and footer across all three pages for both simplicity and ease of use for visitors to the website.

For the user visiting my website, they will want:

  * To know more about me as a producer,
  * Listen to some of my music,
  * Potentially buy the music and/or sign up for updates.
  * Want a mobile friendly website to visit whilst on the go via a mobile phone/tablet
  
My website has been split into pages specifically for each of these user goals. 

  * The biography on the index.htm page has a little about me as a producer, where I from and my background,
  * The listen.html page has four tracks that I've produced for the user to stream from soundcloud via my website,
  * A sign up page for the user to enter their email address to recieve updates on future release dates, gigs, and a newsletter.

I created a wireframe of which the file is in the wireframe directory. This was the first time using wireframes so it was quite simple in design but it put across how I wanted my website to look. Minor deviations from the wireframe structure were made whilst writing the code but on the whole, the layout is the same.

At the time of me doing the project, I have started the process of monetizing my tracks, so that the link from the buy menu will actually take the user to spotify or soundcloud to purchase the music.

## Technologies Used

My project uses HTML and CSS in conjunction with the Bootstrap Framework. I used Google Fonts for the texts and font awesome for the icons.

I have used these because during my studies so far, I have learnt how to use these to incorporate into websites. I felt the icons were a good fit for what I was trying to achieve.

I took pictures from pixabay to use in my project. I used these as they are royalty free and cost nothing. The pictures used are of the highest quality and represented the page of where it was used in my project.

I have used the same logo that I created for all of the pages. Because of this, I used a color picker website to determine the color scheme of the website.
